					<h2>Why Wood Decay Fungi?</h2>
					<p>Fungi which grow on wood are sometimes called "lignicolous" fungi.
						But why develop a set of keys limited to fungi utilizing wood as a substrate?
						After all, being lignicolous does not define a taxonomic category.
						Lignicolous fungi include <u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="A fungus whose spores develop within asci including
                         molds, mildews, and yeasts">ascomycetes</u> and <u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="A fungus whose spores develop in basidia including
                        the majority of mushrooms and toadstools">basidiomycetes</u> and a large number of classes and orders
						within each of these groups. Most of these taxa include both lignicolous and terrestrial species.
						Rather than taxonomy, the keys focus on the biological activity holding this otherwise disparate
						group of fungi together: their ability to degrade cellulose and lignin, the major components of wood.
						This ability is often judged negatively on our part. In fact, the introduction to
						<a class="links" href="http://www.amazon.com/Illustrated-genera-decay-Burgess-science/dp/B0006AWRQO" target = "_blank">Illustrated Genera
						of Wood Decay Fungi</a> by Dr. Fergus states that "This manual has therefore been prepared with the hope
						that it will fill a definite need, that of the general forester to identify decay fungi.
						It will also provide an illustrated Key for use in a Forest Pathology Laboratory course."
						Dr. Fergus indicates that the keys in his manual were based on those used by Dr. L.O.
						Overholts for use in a course in Forest Pathology. Dr. Fergus' book begins to answer the
						question posed earlier. One reason you might want a set of keys to wood decay fungi is
						because these fungi cause economic loss. Forest trees and valuable landscape trees can
						be infected and rotted by these fungi. Knowing the species growing on a tree can help
						the forester determine the likely extent of loss. Different species are associated with
						different amounts of decay in the tree. Additionally, some species are restricted to
						<u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="The soft outer layers of reccently formed wood between
                        the heartwood and the bark">sapwood</u> and will not affect the merchantable volume of heartwood.
						Some fungi can decay sound wood, others decay only decaying wood and bark.
					</p>

					<p>But being able to identify lignicolous fungi causing economic loss is only one reason why keys to
						lignicolous fungi might be useful. In the material below, I briefly describe other important
						reasons people have to know the species of fungi which are found growing on wood. Wood decay fungi
						are the preeminent recyclers of wood in ecosystems. Without these fungi, wood would never decay.
						We would be "up to our eyeballs" in twigs, limbs, and tree trunks. Worse, the valuable nutrients in
						this wood would be locked up and unavailable for new growth. The species of fungi responsible for
						decaying the wood of the different species of hardwood and softwood trees is of ecological interest.
						Wood decay fungi include many sought-after edible species such as <u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="An edible agaric with a soft greyish cap
                            growing in shelving masses on dead wood"><i>Pleurotus ostreatus</i></u>,
						<u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="A polypore mushroom that grows in clusters
                            at the base of trees, particularly oaks"><i>Grifola frondosa</i></u>, and <u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="A species of bracket fungus found in Europe
                            and North America (grows on trees)"><i>Laetiporus sulphureus</i></u>.
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Wood decay fungi are used as mycomedicinals. Preparations made from species such as <u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Known as Reishi
                                mushroom, is a popular medicinal mushroom used in Traditional Chinese Medicine"><em>Ganoderma lucidum</em></u>
							and <u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Known as Coriolus versicolor and
                                Polyporus versicolor, is a common polypore mushroom found through the world. Also commonly
                                called Turkey Tail"><em>Trametes versicolor</em></u> are the mycological equivalent of herbal medicinals.</li>
						<li>Wood decay fungi are screened for pharmaceutical and industrial compounds.</li>
						<li>Wood decay fungi are favorite subjects for photographers and other artists.</li>
						<li>Wood decay fungi are used by hobbyists to dye wool and other fabrics.
							<u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Trametes means 'one who is thin';
                                 Suaveolens means 'sweet-smelling' in reference to the anise scent of fresh specimens"><em>Trametes suaveolens</em></u>, for example, yields a much sought purple dye.</li>
						<li>Wood decay fungi are used by hobbyists to make paper. Many of the species contain tough,
							fibrous cells which, when separated, can be fashioned into ornamental paper products.</li>
						<li>Wood decay fungi utilize different proportions of cellulose and lignin from wood,
							leading to what is termed white rot or brown rot. This character is sometimes given taxonomic importance.
							For example, most species now in the genus <u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="A genus of fungi belonging
                                to the family Polyporaceae"><em>Oligoporus</em></u> were formally included in the genus <u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="A genus of fungi in the Polyporaceae family"><em>Tyromyces</em></u>.
							Tyromyces, however, is now restricted to white rot species and any brown rot species
							formally in it were transferred to the genus Oligoporus which is restricted to brown rot species.
							For example, Oligoporus caesius was formally Tyromyces caesius.</li>
						<li>Wood decay fungi provide fascinating examples of biological relationships.
							For example,  <u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Commonly known as honey fungus, is
                            a basidiomycete fungus in genus Armillaria"><em>Armillaria mellea</em></u> is a much sought edible species.
							It is also one of the few gilled mushrooms that is an important forest tree parasite.
							Armillaria mellea is sometimes parasitized by another gilled mushroom called <u data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="A steely gray entolomatoid mushroom found
                                near decaying wood in eastern North America's hardwood forests"><em>Entoloma abortivum</em></u>, or the Aborted Entoloma. A parasitized Armillaria becomes a more or less solid
							mass of flesh and never develops gills. The two species often grow near each other and
							for many years it was thought that the aborted form was Entoloma parasitized by Armillaria.
							It was only in recent years that the reverse was shown to be true. To call Entoloma abortivum,
							the Aborted Entoloma, now makes little sense but will the name change?</li>
						<li>Wood decay fungi provide subjects for student research projects. For example, students at Messiah College have
							worked with me to study relationships of wood decay fungi to plant species.
							This type of study attempts to determine which wood decay fungi occur most commonly on wood of a
							given species of tree. This sort of study not only requires the identification of the fungus but also the identification of the wood,
							a formidable task at times given that most of these fungi are found on dead logs and stumps in various states of decay.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>A set of keys to fungi restricted to growing on wood eases the identification process for people with all of the above interests.
						Field guides and technical monographs cover all genera and species of a group.
						The identification process can become tedious for groups with many terrestrial species or
						when using comprehensive field guides. Furthermore, technical literature is often not available
						to the general user as it may reside in obscure locations or it may require more technical mycological
						"know how" than that possessed by the general user.
					</p>
					<p>For any of the activities described above, it is my hope that these keys and pictures,
						within their limitations, will be found useful to identify many of the fungi found growing on wood.
