				<h3>Messiah College</h3>

				<p>I want to express my thanks to the many people at <a class="links" href="http://www.messiah.edu/site/index.php" target = "_blank">Messiah College</a>
					who have in one way or another supported my mycological endeavors over the last few decades as I sought to
					deepen my experience with macroscopic fungi rather than the	microscopic pathogens I studied so much in graduate school.
				</p>

				<p>Thanks are extended to Dr. Jeffrey Moshier, Dr. Ray Norman, Dr. Angela Hare
					<a class="links" href="http://www.messiah.edu/info/20198/school_of_science_engineering_and_health">
						(Deans of the School of Science, Engineering and Health)</a>,
					and Dr. Gerald Hess and Dr. Sheri Boyce (Chairs of the
					<a class="links" href="http://www.messiah.edu/info/20200/department_of_biological_sciences">Department of Biological Sciences)</a>
					for their support of this project in the form of release time.
				</p>

				<p>Special thanks are also extended to Les Weiand, former Assistant Director of Academic Computing,
					who patiently explained Dreamweaver and Fireworks, the software used to construct the original web site in 2006.
				</p>

				<p>My appreciation is extended to Ken Mark,
					Director of the <a class="links" href="http://www.messiah.edu/Oakes/">Oakes Museum of Natural History</a>,
					for providing the Oakes Museum web site as a home for this web site.
				</p>

				<p>For the past several years I have collaborated with Dr. Scott Weaver and students in his CIS 432,
					Database Applications class in order to transform the existing version of my website employing
					dichotomous keys and static web pages to a database-driven website utilizing multi-access keys
					and dynamically created pages. The 2016 team of students who accomplished this transformation are Von Bock,
					Emily Budd, Z-Ean Chung, Kafui Dzaka, Huey Hum, and Hoang Nguyen.I am very thankful to Dr. Weaver and his students for this collaborative relationship.

				<h3>Dr. Thomas Volk</h3>

				<p>In addition to sharing his pictures, Tom played a vital role in the early development of this web site.
					For this, I am very thankful. </p>

				<p>I applied for a sabbatical leave for the fall of 2003 after serving as department chair during the previous five years.
					My goal for the leave was to pursue scholarship activities in mycology. From talks I heard Tom give over the years,
					I appreciated, as a fellow teacher, his interest and passion for mycological education.
					Tom didn't know me very well but took a step of faith and agreed to collaborate with me.
					He provided encouragement and ideas to consider during the decision making process leading to
					the concept for this web site. His endorsement, as an external collaborator, was important in
					the approval process for my sabbatical. In the fall of 2003, as part of the sabbatical,
					I traveled to La Crosse, WI, and studied with Tom for a week. I sat in on one of his classes,
					went on several forays, met his graduate students, met some of his University colleagues,
					went on a mycology lab field trip, enjoyed the use of his lab, helped him dry apples,
					saw some great sights around La Crosse, and soaked up as much mycology as I could.
					Tom even planted a rhododendron at his home in my honor. Many thanks, Tom,
					for your hospitality and infectious love of fungi.

				<h2>Eastern Penn Mushroomers</h2>

				<p><a class="links" href="http://www.epennmushroomers.org/"target = "_blank">(EPM)</a> has been a great source of fellowship with others who enjoy these peculiar organisms called fungi.
					I have gained much knowledge about the local mushroom flora from my association with club members over the years.

				<h2>The Photographers</h2>

				<p>Many excellent photographers contributed their pictures to this web site. Without their generosity,
					this project would not be possible. Good photographs bring the organisms to life.
					The many images contained in this work show the beauty of these fungi and help immensely in the process of identification.
					Most of the species are illustrated with several images in order to show structural details and variations in appearance.
				</p>

				<p>In alphabetical order, I thank the following people for their hard work, skill, and creativity as demonstrated
					through their pictorial contributions to this project. As you look at the pictures of the species,
					please note that each picture is credited to the photographer. Pictures not credited are the property of Gary Emberger.
					Please note that all pictures are copyright protected and should not be used without permission of the owner.
